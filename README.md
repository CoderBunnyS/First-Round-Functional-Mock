### Build a Responsive Website!

For my first General Assembly project, I built a responsive website using HTML and CSS. I built this site from a mock provided.

### Instructions

To check out my website, head to this [github page](https://vmipfdr.github.io/First-Round-Functional-Mock/)

or find it here:

### Requirements

I chose a design implemented in Adobe XD from a provided collection of designs.  


The goal is to build an accurate clone of my chosen site. I did my best to get everything looking as similar as possible in approximately 9 hours. Treat it like you were handed this mockup and given a deadline to deliver it. Use all the available resources you've been given - documentation, your peers, your instructors, placeholder images, etc.

Additionally, I made my site responsive (meaning it looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop) but I need to clean up the responsive portion a bit.

In sum, the requirements for this project are:

* Picked a mock and implement it with HTML and CSS
* Made my mock responsive using media queries
* Deployed my website to GitHub Pages
